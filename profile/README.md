# Welcome to PhySU! We hope you like it here

<ins>🚧This page is currently under construction🚧</ins>

This is the GitHub org for the University of Toronto Physics Student Union, abbreviated as PhySU. Here, you will find the materials used in our coding workshops, as well as some utility codes contributed by our members.

## How to use GitHub

Go to the repository you were looking for, either by navigating within the "Repositories" tab or one of the links provided below, then click the green button that says "<>Code" and choose any one of the available options. If you don't want to download the whole thing, you can browse the repositories like you would with folders on your computer and copy-paste the specific scripts you like. However, since we expect these repositories to be frequently updated with new content, we recommend using GitHub Desktop, GitLens (a VS Code extension), or similar tools to keep track of the updates automatically.

## This is still a work in progress, please send us your feedbacks!
If you have encountered a problem with anything in any of our repositories, please tell us about it! You can message us on our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Ss5SyxR) (verified UofT students only!) or open an issue on the respective repository (this is the recommended way since it's easier for us to pin down the problem).
